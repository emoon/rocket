TinyCThread v1.2
================

https://tinycthread.github.io


About
-----

TinyCThread is a minimalist, portable, threading library for C, intended to
make it easy to create multi threaded C applications.

The library is closesly modeled after the C11 standard, but only a subset is
implemented at the moment.

See the documentation in the doc/html directory for more information.


Using TinyCThread
-----------------

To use TinyCThread in your own project, just add tinycthread.c and
tinycthread.h to your project. In your own code, do:

#include <tinycthread.h>

TinyCThread also includes CMake support, so if your project uses CMake
you can just `add_subdirectory(tinycthread)`. Then simply add the
tinycthread target (using `target_link_libraries`) where necessary and
CMake will take care of everything else, including adding the correct
include directory and CTest integration.


Building the test programs
--------------------------

From the test folder, issue one of the following commands:

Linux, Mac OS X, OpenSolaris etc:
  make   (you may need to use gmake on some systems)

Windows/MinGW:
  mingw32-make

Windows/MS Visual Studio:
  nmake /f Makefile.msvc
